# exhibitions
For any business involved in the trading of goods and / or services the role that an exhibition plays in making sales cannot be overemphasized. From developing new customer interactions to providing a hub on which ideas and concepts can be exchanged, trade fairs and exhibitions have firmly positioned themselves as an indispensible industry function. A lot more, however, goes into participating in an exhibition than just plonking a stall in an obscure section of the exposition and crossing one’s fingers all will go well. Your company stand is a mirror of your brand identity. It serves to communicate the organization’s corporate culture and ethos. With such great stakes, a concerted and expert approach is required to come up with a stand that allows your business to be unique and distinctive, attracting customers, who are the lifeblood of any going concern.
